1、HTTP请求的方法
The HTTP method (also often called “the verb”) tells the server what the client wants to do with the requested page. 
The following methods are very common:

1) GET
The browser tells the server to just get the information stored on that page and send it. 
This is probably the most common method.
2) HEAD
The browser tells the server to get the information, but it is only interested in the headers, not the content of the page. 
An application is supposed to handle that as if a GET request was received but to not deliver the actual content. 
In Flask you don’t have to deal with that at all, the underlying Werkzeug library handles that for you.
3) POST
The browser tells the server that it wants to post some new information to that URL and that the server must ensure the data is stored and only stored once. 
This is how HTML forms usually transmit data to the server.
4) PUT
Similar to POST but the server might trigger the store procedure multiple times by overwriting the old values more than once. 
Now you might be asking why this is useful, but there are some good reasons to do it this way. 
Consider that the connection is lost during transmission: 
in this situation a system between the browser and the server might receive the request safely a second time without breaking things. With POST that would not be possible because it must only be triggered once.
5) DELETE
Remove the information at the given location.
6) OPTIONS
Provides a quick way for a client to figure out which methods are supported by this URL. 
Starting with Flask 0.6, this is implemented for you automatically.
